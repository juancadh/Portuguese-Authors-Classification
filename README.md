# Portuguese-Authors-Classification
Classification of authors by fragments of texts using different NLP techniques.

The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts the author of a text excerpt with 500 or 1000
words.
Starting from a non-balanced corpora composed of several books from different Portuguese writers, the goal is to identify the
author of some pieces of text through the application of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques.
